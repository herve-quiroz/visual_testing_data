# Claude Instructions

## About This Document

**Scope:** These are universal guidelines that apply to all Claude AI work on this repository, regardless of which mode of operation is being used (Claude Desktop, autonomous Claude Code, or interactive Claude Code).

---

## Commit Configuration

* Author Name: `Claude Code`
* Author Email: `herve.quiroz+claude@gmail.com`
* Do NOT add a `Co-Authored-By:` line in commit messages

For branch naming, commit formatting, pre-commit checks, and PR conventions, see the `git-commit` skill.

## Comments (Github issues and pull requests)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: ALL Claude-generated content on GitHub MUST include the footer below. This includes:
- PR descriptions
- Issue comments
- PR comments
- Review responses
- Any other text posted to GitHub

Add the following footer to identify Claude-generated content easily:

```

✨ Content generated by Claude AI.
```

## Planning without timelines

When planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like "this will take 2-3 weeks" or "we can do this later." Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.

**Examples:**

❌ **Don't:**
- "This will take approximately 2-3 days of focused work"
- "Implementation estimate: ~1 week"
- "We can tackle this in the next sprint"

✅ **Do:**
- "This requires changes to: configuration handling, work detection logic, and workspace management"
- "Implementation involves: parsing new environment variable, updating repository selection logic, and adding tests"
- Focus on technical scope and complexity, not duration

## Track issues and blockers

* When blocked in your development because you're missing some capability (e.g. MCP server or access to a specific development tool in your environment), create an issue in this Github repository to describe what's missing
* The issue title should contain `[Claude]` as a prefix. e.g. `[Claude] Missing tool: <some_tool>`
* Check beforehand that a similar issue does not exist. If one does exist, consider adding additional context and information based on the current task at hand
* Avoid duplicate content in the Github issue as this will be read by humans. Consider editing existing comments to refine the explanations rather than adding new comments
* Do not apply the `claude` tag to the issue yourself
* Remember to use the same footer as for other discussions to indicate that the issue content or comment was generated by Claude

## Clean-up changes

* When removing logic, don't leave comments about it. If things don't exist, we don't need to mention them

## Work Control

Only work on issues with the `claude` label and no open dependencies. The `find-work` skill handles task detection and priority routing.

* NEVER add the `claude` label on a Github issue yourself unless it's requested explicitly
* NEVER work on an issue that depends on functionality added by another open issue

## Issue Dependencies

* Never use GitHub's sub-issue/parent-issue feature (addSubIssue/removeSubIssue). Use native blocked-by dependencies exclusively.

## Skill Creation

When creating skills, invoke both `/skill-development` and `/skill-creator` for comprehensive coverage. They provide complementary guidance: `/skill-creator` covers core design principles and conciseness, while `/skill-development` covers writing style rules, trigger descriptions, and validation.

## Interactive Mode Git Workflow

When running in an interactive session (i.e., a user is directly interacting with Claude Code):
- Work on the `main` branch directly — do not create feature branches
- Commit and push changes directly to `main`
- Only create a branch and PR when the user explicitly asks for one
- If the task involves large or complex changes, ask the user whether they prefer a direct commit to `main` or a PR

## Repository-Specific Guidelines

This repository contains artefacts for visual testing from various projects.
